1 - I have used Dapper.net as Object ORM //https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dapper_ORM
     Other alternatives could be EntityFramework, NHibernate etc.
2 - The SQL statements can be stored procesdures as opposed to inline sql
3 - For testing i have used nUnit
4 - Only written 2 test methods to keep it simple although could be more
5 - I have not created a sample DB for keeping it simple and Non DB structure
6 - I have used helper clas in order to avoid hard coded values
